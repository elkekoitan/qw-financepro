# FinancePro Clean Architecture Migration Guide

## Current State

The FinancePro project currently has several structural issues:

1. Inconsistent use of Clean Architecture layers (`domain`, `application`, `infrastructure`, `presentation`)
2. Scattered placement of files (e.g., some components directly under `src/`)
3. Inconsistent naming conventions (some files use .js, others .tsx)
4. Duplicate code for similar functionality (e.g., auth logic)

## Target Architecture

The proposed Clean Architecture structure:

1. **Domain Layer** (`src/domain/`):
```
src/domain/
├── entities/
│   ├── User.ts
│   ├── Portfolio.ts
│   └── Investment.ts
├── value-objects/
│   ├── Money.ts
│   └── Email.ts
└── services/
    └── PortfolioValuation.ts
```

2. **Application Layer** (`src/application/`):
```
src/application/
├── use-cases/
│   ├── auth/
│   │   ├── LoginUseCase.ts
│   │   └── RegisterUseCase.ts
│   └── portfolio/
│       └── CreatePortfolioUseCase.ts
├── interfaces/
│   ├── repositories/
│   └── services/
└── dto/
    ├── auth/
    └── portfolio/
```

3. **Infrastructure Layer** (`src/infrastructure/`):
```
src/infrastructure/
├── repositories/
│   ├── supabase/
│   └── implementations/
├── services/
│   └── auth/
└── persistence/
    └── supabase/
```

4. **Presentation Layer** (`src/presentation/`):
```
src/presentation/
├── pages/
│   ├── auth/
│   │   ├── login.tsx
│   │   └── register.tsx
│   └── dashboard/
│       └── index.tsx
├── components/
│   ├── auth/
│   │   ├── LoginForm.tsx
│   │   └── RegisterForm.tsx
│   └── dashboard/
│       └── PortfolioWidget.tsx
└── hooks/
    └── useAuth.ts
```

## Migration Preparation
