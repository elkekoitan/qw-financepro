# FinancePro Clean Architecture Migration Guide

## Current State

The FinancePro project currently has several structural issues:

1. Inconsistent use of Clean Architecture layers (`domain`, `application`, `infrastructure`, `presentation`)
2. Scattered placement of files (e.g., some components directly under `src/`)
3. Inconsistent naming conventions (some files use .js, others .tsx)
4. Duplicate code for similar functionality (e.g., auth logic)

## Target Architecture

The proposed Clean Architecture structure:

1. **Domain Layer** (`src/domain/`):
```
src/domain/
├── entities/
│   ├── User.ts
│   ├── Portfolio.ts
│   └── Investment.ts
├── value-objects/
│   ├── Money.ts
│   └── Email.ts
└── services/
    └── PortfolioValuation.ts
```

2. **Application Layer** (`src/application/`):
```
src/application/
├── use-cases/
│   ├── auth/
│   │   ├── LoginUseCase.ts
│   │   └── RegisterUseCase.ts
│   └── portfolio/
│       └── CreatePortfolioUseCase.ts
├── interfaces/
│   ├── repositories/
│   └── services/
└── dto/
    ├── auth/
    └── portfolio/
```

3. **Infrastructure Layer** (`src/infrastructure/`):
```
src/infrastructure/
├── repositories/
│   ├── supabase/
│   └── implementations/
├── services/
│   └── auth/
└── persistence/
    └── supabase/
```

4. **Presentation Layer** (`src/presentation/`):
```
src/presentation/
├── pages/
│   ├── auth/
│   │   ├── login.tsx
│   │   └── register.tsx
│   └── dashboard/
│       └── index.tsx
├── components/
│   ├── auth/
│   │   ├── LoginForm.tsx
│   │   └── RegisterForm.tsx
│   └── dashboard/
│       └── PortfolioWidget.tsx
└── hooks/
    └── useAuth.ts
```

## Migration Preparation

1. **Comprehensive Code Review**
   - Conduct a thorough review of the existing codebase
   - Identify all areas that do not adhere to the architecture or coding standards
   - Note specific issues or challenges that need to be addressed during the migration

2. **Risk Assessment and Mitigation**
   - Identify potential risks (e.g., data loss, service disruption, performance degradation)
   - Develop mitigation strategies for each risk
   - Establish contingency rollback plans and backup procedures

3. **Detailed Testing Plan**
   - Develop comprehensive test scenarios for each layer
   - Create end-to-end test scenarios
   - Define test data and expected results
   - Outline a strategy for automated testing

4. **Team Training and Communication**
   - Ensure all team members understand the Clean Architecture principles and the new project structure
   - Clearly communicate the migration plan, responsibilities, and timelines
   - Schedule regular status updates and feedback sessions

5. **Phased Migration Approach**
   - Consider breaking the migration into smaller, manageable phases
   - Define clear goals and success criteria for each phase
   - Conduct thorough testing and reviews after each phase
   - Do not proceed to the next phase until issues from the previous one are addressed

6. **Thorough Documentation**
   - Document every aspect of the migration plan in detail
   - Create a comprehensive post-migration report explaining the changes made to the codebase, decisions taken, and rationale
   - Update project documentation for future reference and maintenance

## Coding Standards

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow the Clean Architecture principles:
  - Dependencies point inwards
  - Layers communicate through interfaces
  - Domain layer is independent of frameworks and databases
- Use consistent naming conventions:
  - PascalCase for classes, interfaces, and components
  - camelCase for variables, functions, and file names
  - UPPER_CASE for constants
  - Prefix interfaces with "I" (e.g., IUserRepository)
  - Suffix DTO classes with "DTO" (e.g., LoginDTO)
  - Use meaningful and descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes
- Organize files by feature or layer, not by type:
  - Prefer `src/domain/entities/User.ts` over `src/domain/User/User.entity.ts`
  - Prefer `src/application/use-cases/auth/LoginUseCase.ts` over `src/application/auth/LoginUseCase/LoginUseCase.ts`
- Write unit tests for all new code
- Use a linter (ESLint) and formatter (Prettier) to enforce code style

## File Structure Optimization

1. Identify unnecessary files:
   - Duplicate files with similar functionality (e.g., multiple auth implementations)
   - Unused or obsolete files (e.g., old test files, backup files)
   - Generated files that can be recreated (e.g., build artifacts)

2. Consolidate scattered code:
   - Move components from `src/` to appropriate layer directories
   - Merge similar functionality into single files or classes
   - Ensure each file has a single responsibility

3. Rename files and folders:
   - Use consistent naming conventions (e.g., .tsx for React components, .ts for other files)
   - Rename files to reflect their purpose or functionality (e.g., `LoginForm.tsx` instead of `Form.tsx`)
   - Update import statements to reflect new file locations

By following this comprehensive migration guide and checklist, the team can systematically refactor the FinancePro project to adhere to Clean Architecture principles, improve code organization, and maintain a consistent and scalable codebase. The detailed plan ensures that all necessary files are properly moved, renamed, or updated during the migration process, while sensitive data is protected throughout.

The additional preparation steps, including comprehensive code review, risk assessment, detailed testing plan, team training, phased migration approach, and thorough documentation, will help ensure a smooth and successful transition to the new architecture.

Note: This guide does not include any sensitive information such as API keys, secrets, or environment-specific configurations. Be sure to manage these separately and securely.
